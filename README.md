Technical Details:
The system uses various types of IoT sensors, including ESP32, Ultrasonic Sensor, and gas sensors. The data collected by the sensors is sent to a cloud-based application for processing and analysis. The application analyze the data and generate reports on the status of the sewage system.

The system also includes a dashboard that allows operators to monitor the status of the sewage system in real-time. The dashboard provides information on water level, gas presence and other important parameters.

Components
ESP32
HCSR04 Ultrasonic sensor
MQ2 Gas Sensor
Breadboard Power supply
Connecting wires
LED Lights
12V 1 AMP DC Adapter
Installation:
The system can be installed in any existing sewage management system. The sensors are installed at various points in the network, such as at pumping stations and treatment plants. The data is sent to a cloud-based server, which can be accessed via a web-based dashboard.

Potential Applications:
This system has a wide range of potential applications, including:

Improving the efficiency and effectiveness of existing sewage management systems
Reducing the environmental impact of sewage systems by monitoring wastewater quality
Predicting potential issues and optimizing maintenance and repair schedules
Integrating with other systems, such as weather monitoring systems, to provide a more comprehensive view of the network
Conclusion:
The Sewage Management System with IoT Sensors is a powerful tool for improving the efficiency and effectiveness of sewage management systems. By leveraging IoT sensors operators can optimize the functioning of the sewage system, reduce operating costs, and ensure compliance with environmental regulations. This system has the potential to greatly improve public health and environmental protection.
